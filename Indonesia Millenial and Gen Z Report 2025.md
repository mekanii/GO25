## Generational Insights:
A Snapshot of Indonesia’s Millennials and Gen Z

Both Millennials and Gen Z support evolving gender roles in the household, but their approaches differ. Gen Z is more proactive in embracing change, while Millennials prefer a more gradual shift, influenced by traditional family values.

### The Rise of Nomad Media
Both Millennials and Gen Z are gravitating towards nomad media—news media outlets established on social media—valuing their blend of credibility and creativity. Gen Z naturally embraces this digital-first approach, while Millennials are also adapting to this shift in media consumption.

### Urbanization and Family Dynamics
Urbanization has pushed both generations to rely on technology to stay connected with extended family. However, Millennials express more concern about the erosion of traditional family ties, whereas Gen Z is more adaptable to these new realities.

### Musical Theater’s Resurgence
Musical theater is making a comeback, appealing to both Millennials and Gen Z. Gen Z is drawn to the immersive live experience, while Millennials find comfort in the nostalgia and familiar themes these performances offer.

### Social Media as a Tool for Activism
Both Millennials and Gen Z use social media as a key tool for political activism, raising awareness and driving discussions around important issues. However, both recognize the need to translate online advocacy into tangible real-world action.

# CHAPTER 01 FAMILY AND VALUES
## Breaking Boundaries from Traditional Roles to New Expectations
Modern Indonesian families are steadily moving away from traditional gender roles, embracing a more balanced approach to sharing household and professional responsibilities. With an increasing number of women entering the workforce, the long-standing notion of the father as the sole breadwinner is evolving. This shift not only marks progress toward gender equality but also empowers women to pursue careers and attain financial independence, providing them with a safeguard against domestic violence and unhealthy household dynamics. Whether as full-time working mothers or through leveraging digital platforms—such as e-commerce, affiliates, and virtual assistant roles—these women demonstrate that motherhood and professional ambitions can coexist harmoniously.

### Embracing the Role of the Modern Father
Despite these advancements, the double burden of domestic responsibilities often persists, underscoring the need for husbands to actively support and share in household duties. Modern fathers are increasingly taking on roles as “househusbands,” supporting their partners’ careers and becoming more involved in family life. This evolving concept of fatherhood is particularly embraced by Gen Z, who are more open to changes in gender roles, while Millennials often exhibit a blend of adherence to traditional values and cautious acceptance of new expectations. By challenging stereotypes and promoting equitable roles, fathers today are contributing to a more balanced and nurturing family environment. This benefits everyone: children gain diverse role models, women are relieved from the dual burden, and men discover fulfillment in nurturing roles.

### Balancing Tradition and Progress in Family Life
Our data shows that both Gen Z and Millennials maintain a deep respect for traditional values, particularly concerning evolving gender roles within the family. While 82% of both generations support gender equality, backing changes in gender roles as long as they don’t disrupt existing traditions, it’s clear that preserving cultural norms remains a significant concern for both groups. This highlights that, while there is growing acceptance of gender role evolution, there is also a strong inclination to maintain a connection to established cultural practices. This delicate balance between embracing modernity and honoring tradition underscores the thoughtful and nuanced approach both generations take toward changes in family structures.

#### How Millennials & Gen Z Respond to Gender Shifting Roles in Family

| Millennials and Gen Z Perspectives on Gender Role Changes in Family Dynamics  | Millenials  | Gen Z |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----------:| -----:|
| Support with Traditional Safeguards                                           |         49% |   50% |

*This data represents 82% of Millennials and Gen Z who support gender equality

However, a clear difference emerges in the degree of acceptance and enthusiasm for these changes. Millennials, though supportive of shifts in gender roles, tend to approach them with caution—48% indicate they need time to adjust. In contrast, Gen Z demonstrates a more progressive stance, with nearly half (48%) fully endorsing the belief that shifting gender roles can bring balance and happiness to the family. This generational gap underscores Gen Z’s reputation for being forward-thinking and adaptable, showing a greater willingness to embrace significant changes in household dynamics. Gen Z’s openness likely stems from broader exposure to global ideas of gender equality and a strong belief in the positive outcomes of such changes, whereas Millennials, despite their support, may still prefer the security of gradual adaptation and the comfort of traditional values.

Kalis Mardiasih, an opinion writer and young Nahdlatul ‘Ulama (NU) activist, reflects on her experiences growing up in a rural area where discussions about gender equality were rare. She notes that it wasn’t until she had access to broader learning opportunities that she began to grasp the wider implications of gender equality. Research suggests that while many express support for gender equality, they often haven’t taken action to advocate for it, primarily because they haven’t faced situations demanding more than just verbal support. Mardiasih stresses that awareness is crucial, but it’s only the first step. She advocates for the creation of communities and safe spaces where individuals are encouraged to speak up and take meaningful action. According to her, progress in gender equality is a process, and every small step forward matters. It’s not about achieving perfection or becoming experts overnight but about making gradual progress and acknowledging the strides made along the way.

### Empowering Women in Their Careers and Beyond
Since 1990, Indonesia has made significant strides in increasing female labor force participation. However, the gender gap remains substantial, particularly when compared to other upper-middle-income countries. Despite improvements in education and a decline in early marriage rates, women’s participation in the workforce has seen only marginal growth. A key barrier that continues to hinder progress is the lack of affordable, high-quality childcare. Our survey found that 40% of women leave their jobs after marriage and childbirth, with nearly half citing family responsibilities as the primary reason.

Investing in childcare is not merely a social necessity but also an economic opportunity. Enabling women to remain in the workforce could significantly boost the economy. According to the World Bank, even a modest increase in women’s labor participation could add as much as $62 billion to Indonesia’s economy. As the country continues to develop its infrastructure and social systems, the rising number of working women will further drive demand for childcare services, creating additional employment opportunities in this sector.

This progress is reflected in the improvement of Indonesia’s Gender Inequality Index, which has advanced from 0.499 in 2018 to 0.447 in 2023. This index considers various factors, including reproductive health, women’s empowerment initiatives, and the ratio of women to men in the workforce. For example, reproductive health indicators such as maternal mortality rates and adolescent birth rates show continuous societal efforts to enhance gender equality. However, despite these advancements, Indonesia currently allocates just 0.04% of its GDP to early childhood care and development, far below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recommendation of 1%. Increasing this investment could yield substantial benefits, potentially adding up to $62 billion to Indonesia’s GDP annually.

To unlock these benefits, the Indonesian government could consider several key actions:
- Establish a national policy with clear goals and responsibilities to increase the availability and quality of childcare services.
- Implement fiscal programs aimed at making childcare more affordable, particularly for low-income families.
- Invest in the childcare sector by supporting women entrepreneurs in starting and running childcare businesses.
- Launch awareness campaigns to emphasize the importance of childcare and the need for societal support for working women.
