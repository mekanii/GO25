# INDONESIA MILLENIAL AND GEN Z REPORT 2025
## About the Report
As we present the Indonesia Millennial and Gen Z Report 2025, IDN brings together key insights from across the country, highlighting the evolving role of two generations that are shaping Indonesia’s future. Millennials and Gen Z are not just participants in change—they’re leading it, stepping into positions of influence and redefining what it means to be part of a rapidly shifting society.

With political shifts, technological advances, and the increasing dominance of digital life, both generations are taking on leadership roles, pushing for positive change, and advocating for sustainability. They are hopeful about Indonesia’s economic recovery and see encouraging progress in areas like work-life balance, inclusivity, and mental health support in the workplace.

Yet, challenges are still at the forefront. Issues such as the rising cost of living, job insecurity, climate change, and mental health continue to weigh on the minds of many. As AI and automation reshape industries, questions about the future of work loom larger. Despite these uncertainties, Millennials and Gen Z remain optimistic, expecting businesses to step up and address both social and environmental issues head-on.

The Indonesia Millennial and Gen Z Report 2025 reflects the determination of these generations—a collective mindset focused on overcoming obstacles and creating a more sustainable, brighter future for the country.

## Generational Insights:
A Snapshot of Indonesia’s Millennials and Gen Z

### Shifting Gender Roles
Both Millennials and Gen Z support evolving gender roles in the household, but their approaches differ. Gen Z is more proactive in embracing change, while Millennials prefer a more gradual shift, influenced by traditional family values.

### The Rise of Nomad Media
Both Millennials and Gen Z are gravitating towards nomad media—news media outlets established on social media—valuing their blend of credibility and creativity. Gen Z naturally embraces this digital-first approach, while Millennials are also adapting to this shift in media consumption.

### Urbanization and Family Dynamics
Urbanization has pushed both generations to rely on technology to stay connected with extended family. However, Millennials express more concern about the erosion of traditional family ties, whereas Gen Z is more adaptable to these new realities.

### Viral Content and Emotional Engagement
For both generations, viral content thrives on authenticity and emotional connection. Gen Z actively engages in creating and sharing viral moments, while Millennials tend to participate more passively, appreciating the cultural shift.

### Economic Adaptation through Frugality
Both generations have adopted frugal living in response to rising costs, but with different focuses. Gen Z prioritizes saving through discounts and deals, while Millennials balance cost-cutting with side jobs to ensure financial stability.

### Musical Theater’s Resurgence
Musical theater is making a comeback, appealing to both Millennials and Gen Z. Gen Z is drawn to the immersive live experience, while Millennials find comfort in the nostalgia and familiar themes these performances offer.

### Education Reform with Kurikulum Merdeka (The Emancipated Curriculum)
The Kurikulum Merdeka resonates with both generations, as it emphasizes real-world skills. Gen Z views the reform as essential for their future, while Millennials welcome it as a necessary update to the traditional education system they experienced.

### Political Engagement Amid Economic Pressures
Economic challenges are driving political engagement for both generations. They are pushing for policies that address job security and fair wages, united in their desire to find solutions to the financial pressures they face.

### Social Media and Mental Health
The mental health impact of social media is evident for both Millennials and Gen Z, with many facing anxiety and stress. Both generations are increasingly adopting digital detox practices to manage their online presence and maintain well-being.

### Social Media as a Tool for Activism
Both Millennials and Gen Z use social media as a key tool for political activism, raising awareness and driving discussions around important issues. However, both recognize the need to translate online advocacy into tangible real-world action.

# CHAPTER 01 FAMILY AND VALUES
## Breaking Boundaries from Traditional Roles to New Expectations
Modern Indonesian families are steadily moving away from traditional gender roles, embracing a more balanced approach to sharing household and professional responsibilities. With an increasing number of women entering the workforce, the long-standing notion of the father as the sole breadwinner is evolving. This shift not only marks progress toward gender equality but also empowers women to pursue careers and attain financial independence, providing them with a safeguard against domestic violence and unhealthy household dynamics. Whether as full-time working mothers or through leveraging digital platforms—such as e-commerce, affiliates, and virtual assistant roles—these women demonstrate that motherhood and professional ambitions can coexist harmoniously.

### Embracing the Role of the Modern Father
Despite these advancements, the double burden of domestic responsibilities often persists, underscoring the need for husbands to actively support and share in household duties. Modern fathers are increasingly taking on roles as “househusbands,” supporting their partners’ careers and becoming more involved in family life. This evolving concept of fatherhood is particularly embraced by Gen Z, who are more open to changes in gender roles, while Millennials often exhibit a blend of adherence to traditional values and cautious acceptance of new expectations. By challenging stereotypes and promoting equitable roles, fathers today are contributing to a more balanced and nurturing family environment. This benefits everyone: children gain diverse role models, women are relieved from the dual burden, and men discover fulfillment in nurturing roles.

### Balancing Tradition and Progress in Family Life
Our data shows that both Gen Z and Millennials maintain a deep respect for traditional values, particularly concerning evolving gender roles within the family. While 82% of both generations support gender equality, backing changes in gender roles as long as they don’t disrupt existing traditions, it’s clear that preserving cultural norms remains a significant concern for both groups. This highlights that, while there is growing acceptance of gender role evolution, there is also a strong inclination to maintain a connection to established cultural practices. This delicate balance between embracing modernity and honoring tradition underscores the thoughtful and nuanced approach both generations take toward changes in family structures.

> *This data represents 82% of Millennials and Gen Z who support gender equality

However, a clear difference emerges in the degree of acceptance and enthusiasm for these changes. Millennials, though supportive of shifts in gender roles, tend to approach them with caution—48% indicate they need time to adjust. In contrast, Gen Z demonstrates a more progressive stance, with nearly half (48%) fully endorsing the belief that shifting gender roles can bring balance and happiness to the family. This generational gap underscores Gen Z’s reputation for being forward-thinking and adaptable, showing a greater willingness to embrace significant changes in household dynamics. Gen Z’s openness likely stems from broader exposure to global ideas of gender equality and a strong belief in the positive outcomes of such changes, whereas Millennials, despite their support, may still prefer the security of gradual adaptation and the comfort of traditional values.

Kalis Mardiasih, an opinion writer and young Nahdlatul ‘Ulama (NU) activist, reflects on her experiences growing up in a rural area where discussions about gender equality were rare. She notes that it wasn’t until she had access to broader learning opportunities that she began to grasp the wider implications of gender equality. Research suggests that while many express support for gender equality, they often haven’t taken action to advocate for it, primarily because they haven’t faced situations demanding more than just verbal support. Mardiasih stresses that awareness is crucial, but it’s only the first step. She advocates for the creation of communities and safe spaces where individuals are encouraged to speak up and take meaningful action. According to her, progress in gender equality is a process, and every small step forward matters. It’s not about achieving perfection or becoming experts overnight but about making gradual progress and acknowledging the strides made along the way.

### Empowering Women in Their Careers and Beyond
Since 1990, Indonesia has made significant strides in increasing female labor force participation. However, the gender gap remains substantial, particularly when compared to other upper-middle-income countries. Despite improvements in education and a decline in early marriage rates, women’s participation in the workforce has seen only marginal growth. A key barrier that continues to hinder progress is the lack of affordable, high-quality childcare. Our survey found that 40% of women leave their jobs after marriage and childbirth, with nearly half citing family responsibilities as the primary reason.

Investing in childcare is not merely a social necessity but also an economic opportunity. Enabling women to remain in the workforce could significantly boost the economy. According to the World Bank, even a modest increase in women’s labor participation could add as much as $62 billion to Indonesia’s economy. As the country continues to develop its infrastructure and social systems, the rising number of working women will further drive demand for childcare services, creating additional employment opportunities in this sector.

This progress is reflected in the improvement of Indonesia’s Gender Inequality Index, which has advanced from 0.499 in 2018 to 0.447 in 2023. This index considers various factors, including reproductive health, women’s empowerment initiatives, and the ratio of women to men in the workforce. For example, reproductive health indicators such as maternal mortality rates and adolescent birth rates show continuous societal efforts to enhance gender equality. However, despite these advancements, Indonesia currently allocates just 0.04% of its GDP to early childhood care and development, far below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recommendation of 1%. Increasing this investment could yield substantial benefits, potentially adding up to $62 billion to Indonesia’s GDP annually.

To unlock these benefits, the Indonesian government could consider several key actions:
- Establish a national policy with clear goals and responsibilities to increase the availability and quality of childcare services.
- Implement fiscal programs aimed at making childcare more affordable, particularly for low-income families.
- Invest in the childcare sector by supporting women entrepreneurs in starting and running childcare businesses.
- Launch awareness campaigns to emphasize the importance of childcare and the need for societal support for working women.

As gender roles evolve, the strategies Millennials and Gen Z use to achieve financial independence are also shifting. Our data suggests that Millennials adopt a more balanced approach, placing slightly greater emphasis on both saving/investing and creating household budgets. With 39% of Millennials prioritizing budgeting compared to 34% of Gen Z, it’s clear that Millennials favor a more structured and organized method for managing their finances. This focus on budgeting underscores a generational preference for financial planning and structure, likely influenced by their current life stages and financial responsibilities.

Additionally, both generations show a strong interest in increasing income through side jobs or small businesses, with 43% of Gen Z and 44% of Millennials employing this strategy. This shared approach reflects a recognition across generations of the importance of diversifying income sources in today’s economic environment. However, the slight differences in financial priorities reveal a generational divide: Gen Z leans more toward investing and wealth accumulation as key strategies for long-term financial security, while Millennials focus more on budgeting and financial planning to achieve stability and independence.

### Opening Doors for Women’s Empowerment and Growth
Kalis Mardiasih highlights that daycare services are not just a modern innovation but a continuation of Indonesia’s cultural legacy. In many communities, children have traditionally been raised collectively—not just by their parents, but also by grandparents, neighbors, and extended family members. As more women enter the workforce, expanding access to daycare is essential for promoting gender equality. However, it is vital to ensure that these services are accessible to everyone, regardless of their location. By embracing and expanding daycare, Indonesia can honor its tradition of communal caregiving while empowering women to pursue their professional goals without compromising their roles as mothers.

“Daycare isn’t just a modern necessity; it’s deeply connected to our tradition of families and communities raising children together. As more women enter the workforce, ensuring accessible daycare becomes essential not only for gender equality but also for empowering families to make informed financial decisions. Expanding these services supports women in their careers, while families can plan their finances with greater confidence, knowing their children are well cared for” — Kalis Mardiasih, an Opinion Writer and Young Nahdlatul ‘Ulama (NU) Activist.

Investing in childcare is, fundamentally, an investment in Indonesia’s future. It supports working women, encourages greater involvement from husbands in household responsibilities, strengthens the economy, and fosters a more inclusive society. By taking these steps, the government can unlock Indonesia’s full potential and pave the way for a brighter, more equitable future.

## Redefining Relationships with New Perspectives on Marriage and Divorce
Indonesia is undergoing a profound transformation in family dynamics, particularly in marriage, where rising divorce rates and changing attitudes towards traditional unions are reshaping the social fabric. Over the past few years, the country has experienced a significant increase in divorce rates, with data from the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) showing that the number of divorce cases has steadily climbed, reaching up to 500,000 annually. This alarming trend has raised concerns among various parties, including the government, with the Head of the National Population and Family Planning Agency (BKKBN) warning that the rising divorce rate could threaten the stability and resilience of families.

*Multiple-response questionnaires allow the total result to exceed 100%

The rising divorce rates in Indonesia are a significant concern, with 62% of Indonesians acknowledging this trend. Millennials, especially those living in big cities, are facing increased marital instability. The pressures of modern life—such as financial stress, demanding work schedules, and the complexities of balancing personal and professional responsibilities—are contributing to the strain on marriages.

A common misconception is that women are primarily responsible for the rising divorce rates, particularly since the majority of divorce applications are filed by women. However, this view oversimplifies the complex reasons behind many divorces. In Indonesia, many cases stem from gender inequality and power dynamics that place women in subordinate positions. This often leads to situations where women endure domestic abuse, including emotional, physical, and financial mistreatment. Economic factors also play a significant role, as women frequently work to supplement the family income due to the rising cost of living, while men may not equally share household responsibilities.

The dissolution of marriages impacts not only the individuals involved but also has broader implications for children, extended families, and society as a whole. The emotional and financial toll of divorce can be profound, creating a ripple effect that affects communities and future generations.

### Strengthening Marriages with Better Support and Policies
To address the rising divorce rates and shifting attitudes toward marriage, there is an urgent need for comprehensive support systems to help couples navigate the complexities of modern life. Accessible marriage counseling, community-based support networks, and policies promoting work-life balance are crucial in strengthening marriages and preventing divorce.

Additionally, educational programs that prepare young people for the realities of marriage—focusing on communication, financial management, and conflict resolution—can equip future generations with the tools needed to build strong, resilient relationships. These initiatives should be bolstered by government policies that provide financial incentives for couples, such as tax benefits and affordable housing, to alleviate the economic pressures that often strain marriages.

Supporting women through education, financial opportunities, and legal protections is essential for reducing rising divorce rates and ensuring the well-being of all family members. Financial empowerment, in particular, plays a critical role in enabling women to leave unhealthy or abusive marriages and secure a better future for themselves and their families.

“We need strong support systems to help couples handle the pressures of modern life—things like accessible marriage counseling, community networks, and policies that support work-life balance. Educating young people on the realities of marriage, from communication to financial management, is key to building resilient relationships. It’s also crucial that government policies offer real financial incentives and protections, especially for women, so they have the resources and confidence to leave unhealthy or abusive marriages if needed” — Samanta Elsener, M.Psi., Psychologist & Writer.

### A Collective Effort to Adapt to Changing Views on Marriage
The rising divorce rates and changing nature of marriage in Indonesia present challenges that require a coordinated and proactive response. Policymakers, community leaders, and individuals must work together to create an environment that supports and strengthens marriages, recognizing the critical role they play in the fabric of society.

By addressing the underlying causes of marital instability and providing the necessary support to couples, Indonesia can help ensure that marriages remain a strong foundation for both families and the nation. This collective effort is essential not only for the well-being of current generations but also for the future stability and prosperity of Indonesian society.

The time to act is now. By embracing these challenges with compassion, understanding, and a commitment to positive change, we can build a society where marriage remains a cherished and enduring institution, capable of adapting to the evolving needs and aspirations of its people.

## Parenting Today by Blending Tradition with Urban Life
As Indonesia rapidly urbanizes and undergoes societal changes, the traditional bonds that have long tied families together are being tested and transformed. The Indonesia Millennials and Gen Z Report explores the evolving dynamics of family relationships among Millennials and Gen Z, particularly how these generations balance the deep-rooted communal values of Indonesian culture with the demands of modern life.
