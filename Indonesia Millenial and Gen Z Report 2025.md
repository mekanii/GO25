# CHAPTER 01 FAMILY AND VALUES
## Breaking Boundaries from Traditional Roles to New Expectations
Modern Indonesian families are steadily moving away from traditional gender roles, embracing a more balanced approach to sharing household and professional responsibilities. With an increasing number of women entering the workforce, the long-standing notion of the father as the sole breadwinner is evolving. This shift not only marks progress toward gender equality but also empowers women to pursue careers and attain financial independence, providing them with a safeguard against domestic violence and unhealthy household dynamics. Whether as full-time working mothers or through leveraging digital platforms—such as e-commerce, affiliates, and virtual assistant roles—these women demonstrate that motherhood and professional ambitions can coexist harmoniously.

### Embracing the Role of the Modern Father
Despite these advancements, the double burden of domestic responsibilities often persists, underscoring the need for husbands to actively support and share in household duties. Modern fathers are increasingly taking on roles as “househusbands,” supporting their partners’ careers and becoming more involved in family life. This evolving concept of fatherhood is particularly embraced by Gen Z, who are more open to changes in gender roles, while Millennials often exhibit a blend of adherence to traditional values and cautious acceptance of new expectations. By challenging stereotypes and promoting equitable roles, fathers today are contributing to a more balanced and nurturing family environment. This benefits everyone: children gain diverse role models, women are relieved from the dual burden, and men discover fulfillment in nurturing roles.

### Balancing Tradition and Progress in Family Life
Our data shows that both Gen Z and Millennials maintain a deep respect for traditional values, particularly concerning evolving gender roles within the family. While 82% of both generations support gender equality, backing changes in gender roles as long as they don’t disrupt existing traditions, it’s clear that preserving cultural norms remains a significant concern for both groups. This highlights that, while there is growing acceptance of gender role evolution, there is also a strong inclination to maintain a connection to established cultural practices. This delicate balance between embracing modernity and honoring tradition underscores the thoughtful and nuanced approach both generations take toward changes in family structures.
